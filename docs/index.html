    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Put your fingers on the base positions "ASEU" (left hand) and "OTHN"
      (right hand). That is, your left and right index fingers on "U" and "O"
      respectively. Those are signaled by a small physical mark/bump on the key
      on most keyboards.</p>
    <p>Then start typing the text displayed above the input area, using the
      matching finger for each letter (ignore the numpad).</p>

    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p>There is no "threshold" as to when to move to the next level and how many
      times you should repeat an exercise.</p>
    <p>However, it is important to keep in mind accuracy is more important than
      speed at this stage. Do not try to type fast. In fact ignore enterly any
      notion of speed. Focus on getting accurate instead.</p>
    <p>So, as an example rule of thumb, you could move to the next level when
      you make less than 3 errors.</p>
    <h3>A note on level 5</h3>
    <p>The last level introduces all the punctuations and symbols, and is
      totally optional. I've left it for those wanting to train a bit further,
      but in fact, I suggest you do ignore it.</p>
    <p>Once you've learned the whole alphabet, the best is to simply switch your
      layout "for good" and start using it for your daily activities. That way,
      you will learn the rest "naturally", based on your real-life needs.</p>
    <h2>Keyboard labels</h2>
    <p>It can be tempting to buy labelled stickers to make your keyboard match
      the actual layout, but it is actually not a good idea. The whole concept
      of touch typing is about NOT looking at your keyboard. To look at the
      keyboard, you need to remove partly your hands from it, which defeats the
      process.</p>
    <p>Admittedly, the QWERTY labelling can be confusing, as what you type and
      what you see don't match. Some suggest using a towel to hide your hands
      and keyboard.</p>
    <p>I have never tried this so can't vouch for how practical that is.</p>
    <p>For me, the best solution is to buy whole blank keyboard stickers
      (they're quite cheap), so you won't get confused by the mismatching
      labelling, and get forced into loosing the habit of looking at your
      keyboard.</p>
    <p>Also, be sure to print the layout and keep it handy in sight.</p>
